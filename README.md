# Computer-Architecture
EEC 581 MIPS Assembler

We will build a simulator of a 5-stage pipelined MIPS in C. This simulator  will read a binary executable file containing a sequence of MIPS instructions and simulate their  execution in stages in a pipelined MIPS processor.

Project 4 is the extension of Project 3 by including branch hazard.
